keyboard input goes to the "console" device

Are there test ROMs anywhere?

What would a full uxn operating system look like? maybe https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/potato.html ?
Is PotatoOS any good?

What would a hardware uxn machine look like?
 - want a microcontroller running the cpu emulator (Pi Pico? ESP32?)
 - usb keyboard interface
 - usb mouse interface
 - vga(?) screen interface
 - audio output (+ builtin speaker?)
 - SD card storage? CF storage?
 - nice box
What would uxn on SCAMP look like?
 - graphical output
 - real-time clock
 - mouse input
 - probably too slow, most of this code is written by artists and runs on modern comps
For that matter, could you make an RC2014 emulator for SCAMP?
 - 64k bytes = 32k words
Can I do advent of code in uxn this year?

Bugs in juxn:
 - when an opcode that takes multiple operands is in keep mode, it gets the top-of-stack operand multiple times instead of the correct operands
 - the relative address stuff should take signed int8's instead of unsigned byte's
 - when the vm halts it still carries on finishing the current instruction, which may leave the machine in an incorrect state
 - all the devices are unimplemented
